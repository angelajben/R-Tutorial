In this project, you will perform a cost-effectiveness analysis using `dataset.xlsx`, which is a simulated trial consisting of an intervention compared to control treatment with a 12-month follow-up period. `dataset. xlsx` includes a specific number of subjects randomized to intervention or control groups, their baseline characteristics, and outcomes measured at 4 time points (i.e., 3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Missing variables were introduced into follow-up outcome measures conditionally to age and sex, simulating a Missing At Random (MAR) mechanism.

To run this project follow the steps below:

- Download the workshop material by clicking on *Code* on the top right -> Download ZIP

- Unzip the file and save it on your computer.

- Open RStudio, click on File -> Open project -> where you have saved the unzipped folder *R-Tutorial.Rproj*.

- Then open the *R-Tutorial.Rproj* from the folder assignment (Files window).

- If you don’t have RStudio please download and install it by following the steps from: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

-	Within the project, open CEA.Rmd from the folder R, which can be found in the bottom right window of the RStudio interface.

-	Make sure all the R packages are installed (STEP #1 CEA.Rmd). If packages are not installed, RStudio automatically asks whether these packages need to be installed at the top of the script window (top left window). Click install packages.

-	Continue by running each code chunk separately at a time by clicking on the green arrow on the top right of each chunk.
